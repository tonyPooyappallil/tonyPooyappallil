<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Antony Chacko</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Full-Stack web developer from India</h3>

<h3>About Me</h3>
I'm a tech-savvy individual who loves learning and keeping my brain active. While my passion for technology began early, it was during my Electronics Engineering days that I discovered a deep interest in coding. After working as a Quality Controller for two years, I decided to take a leap of faith and pursue a career in IT.

I joined Masai School, where I trained extensively in Full-Stack Web Development. Through hands-on projects and an immersive curriculum, I built strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, which laid a solid foundation for my professional journey.

I then worked at Tracxn Technologies, Bangalore (Feb 2022 ‚Äì Nov 2022) as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I contributed to both frontend and backend development, collaborated with product teams to build over 20 new features, resolved more than 30 bugs, and refactored key areas of the codebase to improve performance and maintainability.

Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing a Master of Computer Science at Edith Cowan University (ECU), Perth (July 2023 ‚Äì Present). The course has helped me expand my knowledge in areas such as Networking, Systems Analysis, Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, Scripting, Machine Learning, and Project Management‚Äîpushing me to think critically and apply theory to real-world challenges.

For my final research project, I‚Äôm working on ‚ÄúMultimodal AI Techniques for Predicting Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)‚Äù, a condition linked to serious health risks like cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive impairment. Traditional diagnosis using polysomnography (PSG) is often expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. Our project presents three deep learning-based frameworks that combine physiological signal data, craniofacial medical imaging, and demographic information using a late fusion strategy. The models demonstrated promising results, achieving up to 84% accuracy and 0.87 AUC, showing potential for scalable, non-invasive alternatives to PSG for early OSA diagnosis.

I consider myself a strong problem solver and decision-maker. I also value emotional intelligence and enjoy working in collaborative environments. I believe communication, empathy, and adaptability are just as important as technical expertise.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a passionate musician. I sing, play the piano and bass guitar, and upload covers to my YouTube channel‚Äîall recorded in my home studio.

I‚Äôm always open to meaningful conversations, tech collaborations, and creative ideas. Feel free to reach out at antony101tony@gmail.com.
